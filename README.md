Real-time health monitoring using wearables and Apache Spark Streaming

Today data is growing at an exponential rate. 'Big Data Technology' allows us to harness that data for solving problems which were not possible earlier. It can be applied to all domains. This report concerns with 'Big Data' application in the Healthcare domain.

Diabetes is a chronic disease which means it is not easily curable, especially because its detected late. However if diabetes detection can be done early its onset can be averted with proper medical intervention. Now with 'Big Data Technology' we can do early detection and take prompt action. Also 'Big Data Technology' can be used to monitor health status and manage diabetes effectively for those who already have it.

This study attempts to design and create a system using wearables and 'Big Data Technology' for real-time health status monitoring.
